                        <p>
                            I wanted to originally train a chat bot on random twitter accounts like the 
                            followers of Donald Trump or Thoughts of Dog, but the issue I had with this is that
                            the tweets were such a small dataset (and the tweets of DT followers were incomprehensible)
                            that the chat bot just wasn't able to produce great answers. Eventually Cards Against 
                            Humanity did a holiday promotion where they trained the GPT-2 model on their cards. I 
                            learned that the GPT-2 model was trained on 40GB and was available to the public.
                            It understood english grammer and could be retrained to fit whatever I wanted it to.

                        <p>
                            I had to fix some file paths and such put eventually I got it to start training. I thought about 
                            what I wanted to train this model on to see how good it was. I realized that if it could be trained 
                            on fanfic and write and capture the style of those fanfics then that would show how powerful this was.
                            So I scraped a 10MB of Sonic fanfiction from the internet (this was from 1 author, all of Shakespeares 
                            works is around 5.5MB). I trained it and attempted to use my GPU but found out the model wouldn't fit
                            in the memory and trained it on my CPU instead. It was trained for about a day and enough and provided
                            samples that I honestly though were written by an edgy preteen. Now that I knew the model was good 
                            I trained it on other things, from Avatar the Last Airbender scripts to the headlines of various
                            satire sites like the Onion. This entertained me so much because how realistic the results were, 
                            but still silly enough to be make one almost question if it was an original or a generated sample.
