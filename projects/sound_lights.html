                        <p>
                            I wanted to play around with LEDs and I thought it would be cool to get them to be responsive to sound.
                            I was unsure how I wanted them to respond but after buying a threshold mic I settled on changing with 
                            the beat and the timing of the beat.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I got an addressable 12V RGB WS2812B LED strip and a 12V power supply. Using an Arduino Uno I 
                            would wait till the mic was triggered and change the pattern. I ran into some issues with 
                            the Uno running out of memory because I was trying to save too many patterns in RAM. The solution
                            to this was to put any hard coded patterns into Flash. Then I set up some functions to generate 
                            the patterns. I would change the patterns based on the previous beats. So if many beats happen in a
                            row then the pattern would not move. If the beats were farther apart the pattern would move 
                            and speed up every successive beat, until resetting to a previous pattern. Some issues I ran into 
                            was that the power supply couldn't supply the current for the strip and that the threshold mic was 
                            too weak and required the speakers to be right next to it. I got an analog mic that still suffered 
                            from being too weak, but was still strong enough to differentiate beats. In order to detect beats I kept 
                            a rolling buffer of the last 30 readings and checked if the newest reading was higher than the average.
                            This was to prevent the analog mic from getting too much noise in one reading and thinking a beat 
                            happened.

                        <p>
                            While the lights were responsive I should have looked into making my own mic so I could filter 
                            out unwanted frequencies. I do enjoy the light and made a mode that cycles between 4 pre-made 
                            patterns whenever I clap too in case I want a pattern to stay instead of changing every beat. I 
                            also made it ignore some beats because it would change too fast sometimes.
                        </p>
