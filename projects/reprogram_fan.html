                        <p>
                            I found a LED fan an noticed it had a micro-USB port. 
                            I tried just plugging it into my computer's USB port but windows couldn't recognize it.
                            I then popped off the top of fan and saw that the USB was connected to a EEPROM.
                            I assumed that the fan was storing the animations in the EEProm and looked up the IC.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I couldn't connect to the EEPROM with my windows laptop easily so I pulled out a RaspberryPi.
                            With this I could use I2C with the EEPROM to read and write to it. I must have written to it
                            accidently before because when I read from it, it did not make sense and I tried turning on
                            the fan to see that the animations were messed up. I started trying to make sense of some things.
                            I wrote some bytes to the first 15 bytes until I was able to get a character space to have all the 
                            LEDs on. I was also able to make animations a certain number of characters but was still stuck at 
                            the number of animations being 1. I read from another 
                            <a href="http://zjembedded.blogspot.com/2011/08/hacking-led-pov-fan.html">blog</a> that the 
                            the format was first byte = number of screens, next_byte = number of characters, then 5 bytes =
                            character and so on. I tried this format but it did not work. Looking more into it I managed to 
                            discover that the format for an animation was different. It was number of characters, animation 
                            control, then the 5 bytes per character. I played around with the animation control and figured 
                            out which bit did what. Furthermore I found out that I was limited to 20 characters per animation,
                            but I could have alot of animations. I set up a scripts that would take a list of strings less than
                            20 characters and write them to the flash and got the fan show whatever I wanted.

                        <p>
                            This was a fun and easy with the bulk of the project trying to decipher the format after I accidently blew it
                            away. Obviously I would avoid doing that next time. I am not sure when I overwrote the orginal data but it
                            seems to be that I overwrote the first 2 bytes which changed the number of animations and the length of
                            the first animation. Playing with these 2 bytes to fix it ended up showing me alot about the animations
                            and the length of a character so it wasn't all for loss.
