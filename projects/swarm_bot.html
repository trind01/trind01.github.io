                        <p>
                            For Junior Design we were tasked with designing and making a swarm bot that
                            could follow a colored path, detect a magnet, and communicate with ultrasound.
                            We were split into teams and in phase 1 we had to implement each subsytem on 
                            our own. Then in phase 2 we combined with another team and built our bots to communicate with each other.
                            Our bots then had to go through the course.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            We controlled the motor system on a seperate power supply than our Arduino Mega because it
                            introduced to much noise and also required a high current the the pins could supply. The motors 
                            could be controlled by using an H-bridge. We were not allowed to use ICs for certain circuits and 
                            this was one of them so we had to build it ourselves. To detect a magnet we just used a hall
                            sensor. For colored path finding we used a LEDs and photoresistors to determine what colors were 
                            being reflected from the path. The hardest part was the ultrasound receiver and trasmitter. We
                            had to set up several bandpass filters and 5V regulators to get a good signal. The breadboard we used
                            introduced alot of noise that made us think we set up the filter wrong. We soldered it several times
                            before getting a good receiver. When we combined teams we worked more closely than other pairs and
                            split up so that specific sub groups made one thing so the work each subsystem could be made to match.
                            This way the swarm bots remained consistent with each other. We would test, revise, and retest. 
                            Eventually things worked out and were the only team that was able to finish and present on time.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            The hardest part of this project was the receiver. We had to have multiple group members 
                            give it a try before the professor told the issue was all the noise various components introduced.
                            The key to finishing on time was splitting up and making the bots be consistent with each other.
                            This way the speakers and receivers were on the same level and the tracking sensors got equal values 
                            so we didn't have to make differences in the code. This also showed the value of project planning. 
                            By isolating each subsystem we understood each one much more and when it came time to integrate everything
                            we could find issues much faster.
                        </p>
