                        <p>
                            A while back I saw some cool ideas of making claw machines on instructable. 
                            I wanted to make one but and bought some servos to start playing around. 
                            Unfortunately I was always busy with something else. 
                            Then Covid-19 hit and I realized the utility of such a design. 
                            You can not pick up germs from a surface if you don't touch it.
                            I also though how silly it would be to have claws strapped to all our chests to pick up things for us. 
                            With mission in hand and the fact that I could no longer go out at night I got work.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I played around with the servos and 3D printed some arms. 
                            I was orginally going to use just a Photon Board to control the arm, but I ran into some issues. 
                            To control the servo motors I needed to use PWM on 4 motors. I also wanted to use the Photon's wifi 
                            and servers to control the claw. Unfortunately the when the photon tried to control the motors and do 
                            wifi, the wifi would disconnect. I suspect that the motor control used too much power. 
                            So I got a separate Teensy 4.1 board to control the servo motors. This board would get I2C commands from 
                            the Photon board, which in turn got commands from the photon server. I powered the boards through a portable 
                            power bank and I powered the motors through a 6V AA pack. Another issue I can into is that the motors used 
                            so much current that only one could move at a time so I had to code movements to not be done in parallel and 
                            instead be queued up.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project was in no way perfect. It was mainly done because I was bored. The arm could move pretty 
                            well but was hindered by alot of factors. First off the actual base is a Nike shoebox because I didn't 
                            want to spend money on an actual base. But I needed something much more solid and sturdy that I could 
                            mount the base servo on. I just used velcro tape because I had some. Another issue is that the motors 
                            needed much more power than I could supply. An actual power supply would have been much better than 4 AA 
                            batteries. The base servo was not strong enough to lift on it's own and an additional servo could have helped. 
                            Much of this was losely thrown together for fun but I did discover alot about using servos.
