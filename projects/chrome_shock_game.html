                        <p>
                            The Dino Chrome game is a game you can play in the chrome browser when you have no internet.
                            You control a dinosaur jumping over cacti and ducking under vultures. If you touch any obstacle you lose.
                            Your score is determined for how long you are running. I saw a video of someone controlling the the game
                            by jumping, but the barely jumped off the ground because they were using a stretch sensor that had 
                            limited range. So I thought about the best way to detect a jump and thought I could do it with an 
                            accelerometer since I just needed very basic movement. Another issue I saw is that they were plugged
                            into the computer to send commands which also limited your jump range and movement. Additionaly I wanted
                            get feedback from the game to the microcontroller to give some sort of feedback. I was starting to use
                            some bluetooth and thought it would be a good idea to use that to send controls and receive feedback.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            I got an esp32 board since it has many simple arduino bluetooth libraries already established. 
                            In order for the board to detect jumps I printed out results from the accelerometer when I jumped and 
                            I noticed what values changed. I had to do some fine tuning to get a jump and duck to be properly detected.
                            To send commands to my computer I used the Bluetooth Keyboard Library. Every jump sent the up key and 
                            every duck sent the down key. The toughest part came when trying to get feedback from the computer.
                            I didn't want to set up a bluetooth app so I looked for a different way to send feedback. I found
                            out that in nodeJS you can send data using a serial port. There existed a Bluetooth serial port for 
                            the ESP32 so using that I copied the Chrome Dino Game javascript to set up and run the game. I then 
                            set up a node server that will receive a post command from the game when the player loses. This will send 
                            a 'F' character on the bluetooth serial port which tells the esp that the player lost. I decided to have
                            fun with this and if the player loses the esp32 will turn on a relay which will short a pad on a TENs 
                            unit, shocking the player.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Beforehand I did not know much about bluetooth or GATT and probably would 
                            have done this a little differently. The real challenge came when I had to get feedback from 
                            the game to the board. I am unfamiliar with javascript and node some from a class I
                            took. In addition to that I was unsure of what alot of the bluetooth terminology meant 
                            and was mainly making this fast and for fun. This would have been alot easier to get feedback had
                            I set up a GATT characterstic that I could write too. There exists a Google bluetooth web API 
                            that I do not fully understand but could probably work out at this point. The accelerometer worked 
                            pretty well when detecting jumps, sometimes it detected a jump when I didn't jump but I could 
                            fine tune it to work much better. The shocks were as expected, the least fun part about playing the
                            game for the player, but the most fun part for anyone watching the player.
