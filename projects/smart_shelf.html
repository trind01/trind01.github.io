                        <p>
                            We had to solve a problem for senior design but we also wanted to look at 
                            newer technologies. None of the sponsored projects felt very interesting to us
                            and many seemed too ambitious for any groups to do in the time frame. In 
                            addition seniors from the previous year said that alot of time company projects require
                            resources that we won't get until near the end of the year so we can't do much 
                            anyways. After having some spinach go bad in one of our members fridge we decided our 
                            problem had to do with an individuals food waste. We discussed how we wanted to 
                            do this and settled on a shelf that autonomously tracks what food you have, when 
                            you got it, and when it will go bad. We were debating if we want to do with a camera but
                            at the time we were worried we wouldn't get enough images of food and that a camera inside a 
                            fridge would have a bad view.

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            We were using KNN to determine which food was placed on the shelf. This was so we didn't need to 
                            train a model every time the data changed which would happen often for a fridge shelf. We used 
                            location, weight, barcode, and timestamp. In the future we would want more dimensions but we had 
                            to limit the scope since we had other classes and projects we had to deal with in order to 
                            graduate. The shelf was going to track location by using force resistors in an array, but each resistor
                            costed around $7 and we were limited by what we could spend, we opted for a different solution.
                            Using IR LEDs and photoresistors I built an array of sensors. The problem with this is that the array was to
                            wide apart and needed for the lights to be centered on the objects. I had to read the sensors by setting
                            up multiplexers to read specific sensors. After that readings would go to the photon board which
                            would push to the particle cloud. I then set up a raspberry pi to make get requests to the cloud 
                            to see if there was any new datapoints. It would grab those, package them up in JSON and push them
                            to an AWS Database that would process them. We then set up an app in react native that would
                            display what food was in the database currently.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            There were many issues with this project. We needed much more data points, more accurate
                            sensors, more time, but in the end we did get alot out of it. It was a situation where 
                            failure was allowed and we decided an ambitious project when we didn't have the time
                            or money to do it. We would definitely gotten better data if we used a camera but we didn't have
                            much time to research or test. I had to make each IR sensor individually and orginally we wanted 
                            to have a larger grid but had to scale back the scope. I learned alot about AWS and also had to 
                            make Alexa skills since originally we were going to incorporate an Alexa into this. All this got me 
                            to go from the embedded side to the server side and gave me good experience into project planning.
